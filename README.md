Dump Utility
==================

The Dump class provides mechanisms for walking through any arbitrary PHP variable. Built on top, it provides a better dump() function that you can use instead of var_dump.

It requires PHP 5.6 or later.

Install
-----

composer trad3r/dump:*

Usage
-----

You can use static method "show" for view php variable:

```php
Dump::show($var)
```
